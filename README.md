### Build

You need CMake to generate Makefiles and/or project files for your IDE.

1.) Create folder in the root of the repo called ```build```.

2.) ```cd``` into build and run
```bash
cmake ..
```
The default target should be built by CMake. To check what is your default target
run
```bash
cmake -G
```
